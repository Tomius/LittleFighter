LittleFighter
=============

My first bigger 2D game. It was originally supposed to be a clone of LittleFighter 2, just as a programming practice, but I made an entirely different combat system, so it actually offers something new. I wrote this at the fall of 2012, I uploaded it now, so that others can learn from it.

You need [SDL 1.2](http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php) to run this game.
- libsdl1.2-dev, libsdl-gfx1.2-dev, libsdl-ttf2.0-dev, libsdl-image1.2-dev, libsdl-mixer1.2-dev

Use the given Makefile to build, and ./LittleFighter to run.
